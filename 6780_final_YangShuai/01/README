For the cpu code version

To complile:
sh run julia_cpu.cu
To run it:
./a.out
run time:149.106

For the gpu code version

To complile:
sh run2 julia_gpu.cu
To run it:
./a.out
run time:5033.41


The expected result is a bit like the one from Julia code.There should be a window poping up and show you a fractal shape with many colors.The iamge should be 1000*1000.The cpu and gpu versions should have the same result but definitely different running time.No matter how many times the code is run, the result should not be changed.
