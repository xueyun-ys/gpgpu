The CPU somehow run faster(There mimght be a time GPU run faster,but I just cannot figure out 
which part goes wrong...)

The accurate is not as great as I supposed, in which there is a difference around 900k.

If the array goes longer, the speedup might be more obvious with GPU function.Besides, it takes 
time to allocate data to the shared memory for each block and then copy it back to the variety 
in host part, and set room for various parameters we have here.In other words, data transform takes 
some time.Unlike the Matrix, although we could seperate it into many blocks, we have to do the sum 
of each block after that, which also take some time and that part could not be accelerated.Accoding 
to my study, the more thread we have the faster it would be, but it doesnot make much different.
Neither does the number of block.
